a) Code Smells Ex:
	1) Passing customerName and customerEmail to multiple methods is an example of "Data Clumps"
	2) Method calculateTotalPrice is an example of "Long Method"
	3) String creation in sendConfirmationEmail inefficiently builds the final string
	4) Redundancy as specific methods related to Customer existed still in Order.
	5) Unnecessary customerName and customerEmail instance variables in Order class.
	6)Fixed improper names as well as data type issues within class.

b) Code Smells Solutions
	1) Create a Customer class
	2) Extract interior of for loop in calculateTotalPrice
	3) Use a StringBuilder in order to avoid the contiunous creation of new strings
	4) Methods in Order class that were related to Customer were moved to the newly created Customer class.
	5) Replaced the use of these instance variables by simply using .getName() from Customer class.
  6) Turned method into constructor so that the name was proper
