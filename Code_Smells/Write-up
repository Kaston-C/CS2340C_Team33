a) Code Smells Ex:
	1) Passing customerName and customerEmail to multiple methods is an example of "Data Clumps"
	2) Method calculateTotalPrice is an example of "Long Method"
	3) EmailSender is an example of "Middle Man"
	4) Switch in Order class is an example of "Switch Statements"
	5) Unnecessary customerName and customerEmail instance variables in Order class.
	6)Fixed improper names as well as data type issues within class.

b) Code Smells Solutions
	1) Create a Customer class
	2) Extract interior of for loop in calculateTotalPrice
	3) Remove EmailSender class and update sendConfirmationEmail in Order class
	4) Replace switch with simple if-elif
	5) Replaced the use of these instance variables by simply using .getName() from Customer class.
  6) Turned method into constructor so that the name was proper
